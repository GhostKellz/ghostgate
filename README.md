### üí° What is GhostGate?

**GhostGate** is a modern HTTP server and reverse proxy written in Go.
Designed for flexibility, it aims to power:

* Static file hosting (ideal for Arch repo/AUR mirrors)
* Secure reverse proxy for web services
* Eventually: certificate handling, middleware, caching, and beyond

Whether you're serving `.pkg.tar.zst` files or routing traffic to internal services, **GhostGate** is a reliable, lightweight entrypoint.
